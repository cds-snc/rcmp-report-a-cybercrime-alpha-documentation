<h1 id="learning-by-building-and-testing-prototypes">Learning by building and testing prototypes</h1>

<p>In Alpha, the delivery team focused on building prototypes, testing those with users, learning from them, and iterating based on what we learned.</p>

<p>By putting something tangible in front of people who have been affected by cybercrime or fraud, we were able to learn about what they needed and adjust prototypes to address more of those needs.</p>

<hr />

<p>You can find an overview of the prototypes that have been built, tested, and iterated on, below.</p>

<h2 id="concept-1-reporting-cybercrime-with-a-single-identifier"><a href="https://rac-concept-1.herokuapp.com/">Concept 1: Reporting cybercrime with a single identifier</a></h2>
<p><em>(Built in April 2019)</em></p>

<h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>
<p>The first concept was based on the hypothesis that the effort it takes to submit information around a cybercrime event should be correlated to the impact of the crime.</p>

<h3 id="features">Features</h3>
<p>A low-burden tool to alert the RCMP of a suspicious email address, phone number, or website:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Landing page that outlines the purpose</li>
  <li>Omnibox input field that submits a single identifier</li>
  <li>Data visualization that shows victims they are not alone</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="outcomes">Outcomes</h3>
<p>Testing the concept with seniors and newcomers to Canada, we learned about:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Making the purpose and value of the service clearer and having a strong call to action</li>
  <li>Being explicit about which government or law enforcement entity is receiving the report</li>
  <li>Using language that resonnates with victims
    <ul>
      <li>Precise, direct, instructional language</li>
      <li>“Scams” rather than “cybercrimes”</li>
      <li>“Reporting” rather than “sharing”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="concept-2-finding-out-where-to-report-scams-and-online-crimes"><a href="https://rac-concept-2.herokuapp.com/">Concept 2: Finding out where to report scams and online crimes</a></h2>
<p><em>(Built in May 2019)</em></p>

<h3 id="goals-1">Goals</h3>
<p>The second concept was based on the hypothesis that constructing a visual narrative can help triage victims to the appropriate avenue for sharing their cybercrime experience.</p>

<h3 id="features-1">Features</h3>
<p>A decision tree to find the most relevant reporting option:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Side-by-side cards with illustrations that present a choice</li>
  <li>Navigation to one clear reporting option that aligns with choices made</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="outcomes-1">Outcomes</h3>
<p>Testing the concept with library-goers, we learned about:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How victims think about cybercrime, how they make decisions on reporting options and expectations from different channels</li>
  <li>Reasons why many victims prefer to talk to someone over the phone:
    <ul>
      <li>Emotional reassurance</li>
      <li>Advice and guidance</li>
      <li>They believed it would result in action</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Expectations victims have in receiving a follow-up:
    <ul>
      <li>For validation</li>
      <li>To confirm their report was received</li>
      <li>In case more information is needed</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="prototype-1-reporting-scams-in-a-structured-form"><a href="https://www.report-a-cybercrime.alpha.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/p1">Prototype 1: Reporting scams in a structured form</a></h2>
<p><em>(Built in July 2019)</em></p>

<h3 id="goals-2">Goals</h3>
<p>This prototype was designed to test how victims of cybercrime engage with a longer form that asks preset questions. It was based on the <a href="https://report-a-cybercrime.alpha.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/CAFCFRS/">baseline fraud reporting form</a>, and was re-designed to lower the cognitive load by simplifying layout, content, and interactions. It reduces content for easier reading and uses more accessible language.</p>

<h3 id="features-2">Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Structured input fields</li>
  <li>Landing page with purpose and what to prepare</li>
  <li>Divided into short skippable sections
    <ul>
      <li>Event description (what, when, how)</li>
      <li>Money lost (focus on impact rather than fraud type)</li>
      <li>Scammer details (suspect information pared down)</li>
      <li>Evidence (file upload without description)</li>
      <li>Contact details (only asking for name, email, phone number)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Review report information</li>
  <li>Reference number provided</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="outcomes-2">Outcomes</h3>
<p>Testing the concept with library-goers, we learned about:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How to provide more direct and specific questions</li>
  <li>The need to contextualize the unknown National Cybercrime Coordination Unit (NC3)</li>
  <li>The need for victims to predict what they will be asked to do next, both at the onset and from page-to-page</li>
  <li>Dates are sometimes difficult to recall, especially if it was a long time ago or if it took place over a period of time</li>
  <li>That victims are unsure how they can provide scammer details if they do not know who the scammer is for certain</li>
  <li>How victims expect to share evidence, especially non-computer related evidence or multiple documents at a time</li>
  <li>Usability issues that could be fixed prior to large-scale usability testing</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="prototype-2-reporting-scams-in-an-open-form"><a href="https://www.report-a-cybercrime.alpha.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/p2">Prototype 2: Reporting scams in an open form</a></h2>
<p><em>(Built in August 2019)</em></p>

<h3 id="goals-3">Goals</h3>
<p>This prototype was designed to test how victims respond to an open form. It applies learnings from research with both victims and police of jurisdiction, to learn about providing flexiblity, emotional reassurance, guidance/recommendations, and clear expectations.</p>

<h3 id="features-3">Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Mostly open text fields</li>
  <li>Timeframe as date range</li>
  <li>Reassuring language</li>
  <li>Examples and prompts</li>
  <li>Clues about the suspect and evidence combined</li>
  <li>Asking about the impact of the scam</li>
  <li>Contact information (name, email, postal code)</li>
  <li>Next steps, recommended links to get help, other reporting options</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="outcomes-3">Outcomes</h3>
<p>Testing the concept with library-goers, we learned about:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Clarifying the purpose of reporting (what police would do with reports)</li>
  <li>How to add visual emphasis to action items related to people’s goals</li>
  <li>Allowing for approximate date picking</li>
  <li>Providing examples to reduce ambiguity</li>
  <li>Words that reduce confusion in French</li>
  <li>Usability issues that could be fixed prior to large-scale usability testing</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="putting-prototypes-to-the-test-in-a-quantitative-study">Putting prototypes to the test in a quantitative study</h2>
<p><em>(Run in September 2019)</em></p>

<h3 id="goals-4">Goals</h3>
<p>To evaluate the effectiveness of an online service designed to help victims report a cybercrime to the police, three versions of the service were compared: the <a href="https://report-a-cybercrime.alpha.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/CAFCFRS/">baseline fraud reporting system</a>, <a href="https://www.report-a-cybercrime.alpha.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/p1">Prototype 1</a>, and <a href="https://www.report-a-cybercrime.alpha.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/p2">Prototype 2</a>.</p>

<p>The purpose was to test whether the current iteration of the reporting form meets the needs of victims and police of jurisdiction (on a larger scale).</p>

<p>We examined how the current iteration compared to other versions in terms of</p>
<ol>
  <li>the quality of users’ experience reporting a cybercrime</li>
  <li>Users’ trust and confidence in the form</li>
  <li>The quality and quantity of reports submitted</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/assets/img/suspects.png" alt="Comparison of prototypes" width="500 px" /></p>

<h3 id="results">Results</h3>

<h4 id="quantity-of-reports-submitted">Quantity of reports submitted</h4>

<p>People using Prototype 1 and Prototype 2 were more likely to complete and submit a report. Over 40% of people who used the baseline opted out of completing and submitting a report.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/quantity.png" alt="Diagram showing quantity of reports submitted" width="500 px" /></p>

<h4 id="experience-using-the-service">Experience using the service</h4>

<p>People report higher levels of usablity for both Prototype 1 and Prototype 2 compared to the baseline form.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/experience.png" alt="Graph showing experience using the service" width="500 px" /></p>

<h4 id="experience-and-intention-to-use-the-site">Experience and intention to use the site</h4>

<p>People report greater intentions to use the current iteration (Prototype 2) than either the baseline form or Prototype 1.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/intention.png" alt="Graph showing experience and intention to use the site" width="500 px" /></p>

<h4 id="trust-and-confidence">Trust and confidence</h4>

<p>People report equal ratings of trust and confidence in reporting for all three versions of the form. They are also equally likely to recommend each of them.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/trust.png" alt="Graph showing trust and confidence" width="500 px" /></p>

<h4 id="report-quality">Report quality</h4>

<p>Each report was rated by three RCMP staff members and averaged. Reports from the current iteration (Prototype 2) and the baseline rated as of the same quality.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/quality.png" alt="Graph showing report quality" width="500 px" /></p>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>

<p>We found that participants were more likely to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Complete and submit a report when using the prototypes</li>
  <li>Rate the prototypes as more usable</li>
  <li>Use the current iteration prototype</li>
</ul>

<p>We achieved these results by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reducing the number of form fields</li>
  <li>Writing easy-to-read questions</li>
  <li>Providing clarity on purpose and next steps</li>
  <li>Including emotional reassurance and guidance</li>
</ul>

<p>The current iteration (Prototype 2):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Maintains quality with improved usability and loyalty</li>
  <li>Increases the quantity of reports submitted</li>
</ul>
