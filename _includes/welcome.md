[File taxes to access benefits](https://claim-tax-benefits.azurewebsites.net/start) is a service to make tax filing faster and easier so low-income Canadians can access credits and benefits. This service was designed and developed by the [Canadian Digital Service (CDS)](https://digital.canada.ca/) in partnership with the [Canada Revenue Agency (CRA)](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency.html).

The service includes both online and paper channels. Both channels are under development and cannot be used to file taxes at this time.

[While the online repository is no longer actively maintained](/continuing-development/)**,** the code is open source and in the public domain â€” all are free to clone and use it.
