The [Canadian Digital Service](https://digital.canada.ca) (CDS) is partnering with [Royal Canadian Mounted Police](http://www.rcmp.gc.ca/) (RCMP) to improve the delivery of the [National Cybercrime Coordination Unit](http://www.rcmp.gc.ca/en/the-national-cybercrime-coordination-unit-nc3) (NC3).

A discovery was conducted back in November to December, 2018
where the team understood the motivations for reporting to the
police.

The team built and tested several concepts and prototypes
between February and August of 2019 to understand the barriers
victims face when reporting and what the police need to help
victims.

This site documents the team's research findings and the
decisions (content-design, technical, etc.) made over the course
of the alpha.

The team intends to deploy a minimal viable product before the
end of 2019 and continue to prototype throughout the next 6
months.
