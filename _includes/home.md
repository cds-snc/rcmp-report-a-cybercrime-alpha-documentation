# Introduction

The [Canadian Digital Service](https://digital.canada.ca) (CDS) is partnering with [Royal Canadian Mounted Police](http://www.rcmp.gc.ca/) (RCMP) to improve the delivery of the [National Cybercrime Coordination Unit](http://www.rcmp.gc.ca/en/the-national-cybercrime-coordination-unit-nc3) (NC3).

This site documents findings from research and the decisions (content, design, technical, etc.) made over the course of the project so far.

## Discovery

From November to December 2018, the team did research to understand the experiences of people affected by cybercrime and fraud and the technology landscape for reporting to the police. 

## Alpha

From February to August 2019, the team continued research to understand the barriers victims face when reporting and what the police need to help victims. They also built and tested several concepts and prototypes.

## Beta

From November 2019 to April 2020, the team intends to:
* Publicly deploy a pilot of the National Cybercrime and Fraud Reporting System.
* Offer the pilot to a small percentage of daily traffic and gradually increase exposure through improving the quality of the report.
* Iterate on the intake form to improve its quality and usefulness.
* Build capacity with an RCMP delivery team to increasingly take on responsibility for the iterative design and development of the service.
