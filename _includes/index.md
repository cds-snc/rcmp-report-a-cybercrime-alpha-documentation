# Introduction

The [Canadian Digital Service](https://digital.canada.ca) (CDS) partnered with [Royal Canadian Mounted Police](http://www.rcmp.gc.ca/) (RCMP) to improve the delivery of the [National Cybercrime Coordination Unit](http://www.rcmp.gc.ca/en/the-national-cybercrime-coordination-unit-nc3) (NC3).

A Discovery was conducted from November to December, 2018,
where the team understood the motivations for reporting cybercrime and fraud to the
police.

The team built and tested several concepts and prototypes in an Alpha phase
between February and August, 2019, to understand the barriers
victims face when reporting and what the police need to help
victims.

This site documents findings from research and the
decisions (content, design, technical, etc.) made over the course
of the Alpha phase.

The team intends to deploy a minimal viable product before the
end of 2019 and continue to prototype in the Beta phase from November 2019 to April 2020.
