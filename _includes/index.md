# Introduction

The [Canadian Digital Service](https://digital.canada.ca) (CDS) is partnering with [Royal Canadian Mounted Police](http://www.rcmp.gc.ca/) (RCMP) to improve the delivery of the [National Cybercrime Coordination Unit](http://www.rcmp.gc.ca/en/the-national-cybercrime-coordination-unit-nc3) (NC3). This site documents findings from research and the decisions (content, design, technical, etc.) made over the course of the project so far through phases of delivery. 

**Discovery**
From November to December 2018, the team did research to understand the experiences of people affected by cybercrime and fraud and the technology landscape for reporting to the police. 

**Alpha**
From February to August 2019, the team built and tested several concepts and prototypes to understand the barriers victims face when reporting and what the police need to help victims.

**Beta**
From November 2019 to April 2020, the team intends to publicly deploy a pilot of the National Cybercrime and Fraud Reporting System and to build capacity with an RCMP delivery team that will take on the iterative design and development of the service.
