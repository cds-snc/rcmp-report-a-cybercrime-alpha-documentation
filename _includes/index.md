# Introduction

The [Canadian Digital Service](https://digital.canada.ca) (CDS) is partnering with [Royal Canadian Mounted Police](http://www.rcmp.gc.ca/) (RCMP) to improve the delivery of the [National Cybercrime Coordination Unit](http://www.rcmp.gc.ca/en/the-national-cybercrime-coordination-unit-nc3) (NC3). This site documents findings from research and the decisions (content, design, technical, etc.) made over the course of the project so far. 

## The story so far

At CDS, we build software in progressively larger and more complex phases, until we know it works and it's made available to everyone. This helps us minimise risks and costs and maximise the delivery of benefits to the public at the earliest opportunity.

### Discovery

From November to December 2018, the team did research to understand the experiences of people affected by cybercrime and fraud and the technology landscape for reporting to the police. 

### Alpha

From February to August 2019, the team built and tested several concepts and prototypes to understand the barriers victims face when reporting and researched what the police need to help victims.

### Beta

From November 2019 to April 2020, the team intends to publicly deploy a pilot of the National Cybercrime and Fraud Reporting System and build capacity with an RCMP delivery team that will take on the iterative design and development of the service going forward.
