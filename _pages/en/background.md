## Cybercrime is Underreported
- Only 32,968 cases of cybercrime were filed in 2018 and most are not solved.[^unsolvedcybercrimes]

- 1 in 5 Canadian businesses were impacted by cybercrime events in
2017 but only 10% of those impacted reported the crime to
police. Even fewer businesses reported any measures to protect
themselves, their customers, and their
partners.[^statscancybercrimeandbusinesses]

## RCMP and NC3
In 2018, the Canadian Federal Government set aside budget to
create the National Cybercrime Coordination Unit.[^NC3] The role of
the unit is:
- Coordinate cybercrime investigations in Canada and work with
partners internationally to combat a wide range of cybercrime
incidents
- Provide investigative advice and guidance to Canadian police
- Produce cybercrime intelligence for Canadian police
- Create a single point of contact for individuals and businesses
to report cybercrime online

## CDS and RCMP Partnership
The Canadian Digital Service was engaged to partner with the RCMP to build and deliver a public reporting tool for victims of cybercrime. This tool, the National Cybercrime and Fraud Reporting System (NCFRS), will feed reports into the National Cybercrime System (NCS) for triage, analysis, and dissemination to respective police of jurisdiction.

## CDS's Role
CDS' role goes beyond typical delivery, however. CDS exists to partner with departments to build capacity in terms of the utilization of modern process' and technology. This is primarily achieved through the adoption of agile software development techniques, product management, iteration, user research, working in the open, and service design. A primary goal being the hope that partner departments will work with these tools and methods once the partnership concludes - and continue to iterate on a digital product.
