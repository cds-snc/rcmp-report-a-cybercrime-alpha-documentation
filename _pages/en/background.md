# About this project

## Cybercrime's impact
Cybercrime costs the Canadian economy between $3 billion and $5
billion a year.[^estimatedcosts]

But, the impacts go beyond economics. Millions suffer the emotional impacts of cybercrime, including feelings of shame, vulnerability, fear, and confusion.

## Cybercrime is underreported

- Only 32,968 cases of cybercrime were filed in 2018 and most are not solved.[^unsolvedcybercrimes]

- 1 in 5 Canadian businesses were impacted by cybercrime events in
2017 but only 10% of those impacted reported the crime to
police. Even fewer businesses reported any measures to protect
themselves, their customers, and their
partners.[^statscancybercrimeandbusinesses]

## The public is concerned but unprotected
87% of Canadians surveyed are concerned about cyberattacks
against organizations with their personal
data.[^concernedcanadians]
A recent survey showed that 20% of Canadians give themselves a
failing grade when it comes to internet hygiene.[^staysafe]

## The RCMP's National Cybercrime Coordination Unit (NC3)
In 2018, the Canadian Federal Government set aside budget to
create the National Cybercrime Coordination Unit.[^NC3] The role of
the unit is:
- Coordinate cybercrime investigations in Canada and work with
partners internationally to combat a wide range of cybercrime
incidents
- Provide investigative advice and guidance to Canadian police
- Produce cybercrime intelligence for Canadian police
- Create a single point of contact for individuals and businesses
to report cybercrime online

## Partnership between RCMP/NC3 and CDS
The Canadian Digital Service (CDS) embarked on a partnership with the RCMP to deliver a public reporting tool for victims of cybercrime and fraud. This tool, the National Cybercrime and Fraud Reporting System (NCFRS), will eventually feed reports into the National Cybercrime System (NCS) for triage, analysis, and dissemination to respective police of jurisdiction.

CDS's role goes beyond typical delivery, however. CDS partners with departments to build capacity in terms of the utilization of modern processes and technology. This is achieved through the adoption of agile software development techniques, product management, design research, iteration, working in the open, and service design. A primary goal being the hope that partner departments will work with these tools and methods once the partnership concludes - and continue to iterate on a digital product.
