## Cybercrime's Impact
Cybercrime costs the Canadian economy between $3 billion and $5
billion a year.[^1]

## Cybercrime is Underreported
- Only 32,968 cases of cybercrime were filed in 2018 and most are not solved.[^2]

- 1 in 5 Canadian businesses were impacted by cybercrime events in
2017 but only 10% of those impacted reported the crime to
police. Even fewer businesses reported any measures to protect
themselves, their customers, and their partners.[^3]

## Public is concerned but unprotected
87% of Canadians surveyed are concerned about cyberattacks
against organizations with their personal data.[^4]
A recent survey showed that 20% of Canadians give themselves a
failing grade when it comes to internet hygiene.[^5]
