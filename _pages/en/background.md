- Cybercrime's Impact
- Cybercrime is Under-reported
- Where did NC3 come from
- CDS' role with NC3/RCMP

The Canadian Digital Service was engaged to partner with the RCMP to build and deliver a public reporting tool for victims of cybercrime. This tool, the National Cybercrime and Fraud Reporting System (NCFRS), will feed reports into the National Cybercrime System (NCS) for triage, analysis, and dissemination to respective police of jurisdiction.

CDS' role goes beyound typical delivery, however. CDS exists to partner with departments to build capacity in terms of utlization of modern processess and technology. This is primarily acheived through adoption of agile software development techniques, product management, iteration, user research, working in the open, and service design. A primary goal being the hope that partner departments will work with these tools and methods once the partnership concludes - and continue to iterate on a digital product.
