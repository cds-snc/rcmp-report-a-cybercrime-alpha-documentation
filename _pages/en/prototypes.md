# Learning by building and testing

In Alpha, we focused on building prototypes, testing those with users, learning from them and iterating based on what we learned. By putting something tangible in front of people who have been affected by cybercrime or fraud in the past, we were able to learn about what they needed and adjust prototypes to address more of those needs. You can find an overview of the prototypes we've built, tested and iterated below.

## Concept 1: Reporting cybercrime with a single identifier

### [See Concept 1](https://rac-concept-1.herokuapp.com/) 
*(April 2019)*

### Goals
The first concept was based on the hypothesis that the effort it takes to submit information around a cybercrime event should be correlated to the impact of the crime. 

### Features
A low-burden tool to alert the RCMP:
 * Landing page that outlines the purpose
 * Omnibox input field that submits a single identifier
 * Data visualization that shows victims they are not alone

### Outcomes
 * Clarified the purpose of the prototype
 * Learned how victims expect to share their experiences
 * Revealed language that resonnates with victims

## Concept 2: Finding out where to report cybercrime

### [See Concept 2](https://rac-concept-2.herokuapp.com/)
*(May 2019)*

### Goals
The second concept was based on the hypothesis that constructing a visual narrative can help triage victims to the appropriate avenue for sharing their cybercrime experience. 

### Features
A decision tree to find the most relevant reporting option
 * Side-by-side cards with illustrations that present a choice 
 * Navigation to one clear option that aligns with choices made  
 
### Outcomes
 * Learned about how victims think about cybercrime and make decisions about where to report
   * What constitutes an urgent situation
   * What type of information victims have to report
   * When victims prefer to talk to someone 
   * How victims expect to receive a follow-up

## Prototype 1: Reporting with a simplified version of the baseline fraud reporting form

### [See Prototype 1](https://www.report-a-cybercrime.alpha.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/p1)
*(July 2019)*

### Goals
This prototype was designed to test how victims of cybercrime engage with a form that asks preset questions. It was based on the closest online reporting service that exists in Canada, the [basline fraud reporting system](https://report-a-cybercrime.alpha.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/CAFCFRS/), and early learnings from Alpha. 

### Features
Re-designed baseline reporting form
 * Structured form fields
 * Divided into short sections
  * Event description
  * Money lost (focus on impact > type)
  * Suspect information
  * File upload
  * Contact details
 * Reference number provided
 
### Outcomes
 *

## Prototype 2: Reporting more flexibly with reassurance and guidance

### [See Prototype 2](https://www.report-a-cybercrime.alpha.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/p2)
*(August 2019)*

### Goals
This prototype was designed to test how victims respond to an open form. It applies learnings from research with victims and police of jurisdiction, including the need to provide emotional reassurance, guidance, and setting clear expectations.

### Features
Iteration of Prototype 1
 * Provides flexibility in how people report
 * Asks about impact
 * Uses reassuring language
 * Provides guidance on what happens next

### Outcomes
 *
