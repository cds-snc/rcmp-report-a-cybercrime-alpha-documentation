In Alpha, we focused on building prototypes, testing those with users, learning from them and iterating based on what we learned. By putting something tangible in front of people at the earliest opportunity, we were able to learn a lot. We gathered both qualitative and quantitative insights from research directly with people who have been affected by cybercrime and fraud.

You can find an overview of all the prototypes below:
[Concept 1: Reporting cybercrime with a single identifier](https://rac-concept-1.herokuapp.com/)
[Concept 2: Finding out where to report cybercrime](https://rac-concept-2.herokuapp.com/)
[Baseline fraud reporting form](https://report-a-cybercrime.alpha.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/CAFCFRS/)
[Prototype 1: A simplified version of the baseline form](https://www.report-a-cybercrime.alpha.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/p1)
[Prototype 2: A more flexible version of prototype 1 with reassurance and guidance](https://www.report-a-cybercrime.alpha.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/p2)

# [Concept 1: Reporting cybercrime with a single identifier](https://rac-concept-1.herokuapp.com/)

## Goals
The first concept was based on the hypothesis that the effort it takes to submit information around a cybercrime event should be correlated to the impact of the crime. 

## Features
A low-burden tool to alert the RCMP:
 * Landing page that outlines the purpose of the service
 * Omnibox input field that submits a single identifier
 * Data visualization that shows victims they are not alone

## Outcomes
 * Clarified the purpose of the prototype
 * Learned how victims expect to share their experiences
 * Revealed language that resonnates with victims

# [Concept 2: Finding out where to report cybercrime](https://rac-concept-2.herokuapp.com/)

## Goals
The second concept was based on the hypothesis that constructing a visual narrative can help triage victims to the appropriate avenue for sharing their cybercrime experience. 

## Features
A decision tree to find the most relevant reporting option
 * Cards with illustrations that present victims with choices 

## Outcomes
 * Learned about mental models for how victims think about cybercrime and reporting 
  * What constitutes an urgent situation for victims
  * What type of information victims have to report
  * When victims would prefer to talk to someone
  * How victims expect to receive a follow-up
