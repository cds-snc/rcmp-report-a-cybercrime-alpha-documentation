# Learning by building and testing prototypes

## What we did

In Alpha, we focused on building prototypes, testing those with users, learning from them, and iterating based on what we learned. By putting something tangible in front of people who have been affected by cybercrime or fraud, we were able to learn about what they needed and adjust prototypes to address more of those needs. 

You can find an overview of the prototypes that have been built, tested, and iterated on, below:

 * [Concept 1: Reporting cybercrime with a single identifier](https://rac-concept-1.herokuapp.com/) *(Built in April 2019)*
 * [Concept 2: Finding out where to report scams and online crimes](https://rac-concept-2.herokuapp.com/) *(Built in May 2019)*
 
 * [Prototype 1: Reporting scams in a structured form](https://www.report-a-cybercrime.alpha.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/p1) *(Built in July 2019)*
 * [Prototype 2: Reporting scams in an open form](https://www.report-a-cybercrime.alpha.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/p2) *(Built in August 2019)*
 
## What we learned from testing early concepts

The low-fidelity concepts we built were a quick way to test different directions. We learned a lot by testing these with seniors, library-goers, and newcomers to Canada:
 * Make the purpose and value of the service clear and have a strong call to action.
 * Be explicit about which government or law enforcement entity will receive the report.
 * Use language that resonnates with victims:
   * Precise, direct, instructional language.
   * "Scams" rather than "cybercrimes".
   * "Reporting" rather than "sharing".
 * Victims may prefer to talk to someone over the phone for:
   * Emotional reassurance.
   * Advice and guidance.
   * They believed it would result in action.
 * Victims expect to receive a follow-up:
   * For validation
   * To confirm their report was received
   * In case more information is needed

## Barriers to reporting

## What we learned from Police of Jurisdiction

## How we applied what we learned

### Victims cannot provide data all at once, or without structure.
 > "Some people will only answer 1 of 6 questions. It's a lot for them to process." 
 — Frontline staff
 
### Victims feel let down and stop reporting when what happens next is not what they expect.
 > "Victims visit the next day to ask for case updates or send emails to see if we received [their report]" 
 — Frontline staff

 ![After]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/after.png){:width="500 px"}
 
 ### Victims avoid reporting because they're ashamed and feel at fault.
 > "When [victims] felt safe, and felt that it wasn't their fault, they opened up more and provided more details" 
 — Officer taking reports over the phone

 ### Victims use different language than law enforcement.
Police reword required data fields so that victims understand them.

 ### Victims need to protect themselves from ongoing or future attacks.
 > "I'm saying the same sentence day after day to these poor folks... there needs to be more preventative, proactive help. We get a lot of 'I don't know how I fell for this', after the fact" 
 — Officer taking reports over the phone

## What we learned from running a quantitative experiment

To evaluate the effectiveness of an online service designed to help victims report a cybercrime to the police, three versions of the service were compared: the [baseline fraud reporting system](https://report-a-cybercrime.alpha.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/CAFCFRS/), [Prototype 1](https://www.report-a-cybercrime.alpha.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/p1), and [Prototype 2](https://www.report-a-cybercrime.alpha.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/p2).

The purpose was to test whether the current iteration (Prototype 2) of the reporting form meets the needs of victims and police of jurisdiction (on a larger scale).

We examined how the current iteration compared to other versions in terms of 
1. the quality of users' experience reporting a cybercrime
2. Users' trust and confidence in the form
3. The quality and quantity of reports submitted

![Comparison of prototypes]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/suspects.png){:width="500 px"}

### Prototype 1
This prototype was designed to test how victims of cybercrime engage with a longer form that asks preset questions. It was based on the [baseline fraud reporting form](https://report-a-cybercrime.alpha.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/CAFCFRS/), and was re-designed to lower the cognitive load by simplifying layout, content, and interactions. It reduces content for easier reading and uses more accessible language.

Features:
 * Structured input fields
 * Landing page with purpose and what to prepare
 * Divided into short skippable sections
   * Event description (what, when, how)
   * Money lost (focus on impact rather than fraud type)
   * Scammer details (suspect information pared down)
   * Evidence (file upload without description)
   * Contact details (only asking for name, email, phone number)
 * Review report information
 * Reference number provided
 
### Prototype 2
This prototype was designed to test how victims respond to an open form. It applies learnings from research with both victims and police of jurisdiction, to learn about providing flexiblity, emotional reassurance, guidance/recommendations, and clear expectations.

Features:
 * Mostly open text fields
 * Timeframe as date range
 * Reassuring language
 * Examples and prompts
 * Clues about the suspect and evidence combined
 * Asking about the impact of the scam
 * Contact information (name, email, postal code)
 * Next steps, recommended links to get help, other reporting options

### Recommendations from usability testing 
 
 * Contextualize the unknown National Cybercrime Coordination Unit (NC3).
 * Allow victims to predict what they will be asked to do next, both at the onset and from page-to-page.
 * Dates 
 * Do not make suspect details mandatory, as victims are unsure how they can provide scammer details if they do not know who the scammer is for certain.
 * Make it easy for victims to share evidence, especially non-computer related evidence or multiple documents at a time.
 * Clarify the purpose of reporting and what police do with reports.
 * Allow for approximate date picking, since dates can be difficult to recall, especially if it was a long time ago or if it took place over a period of time.
 * Provide examples to reduce ambiguity and add visual emphasis to action items related to people's goals.

### Quantity of reports submitted

People using Prototype 1 and Prototype 2 were more likely to complete and submit a report. Over 40% of people who used the baseline opted out of completing and submitting a report.

### Experience using the service

People report higher levels of usablity for both Prototype 1 and Prototype 2 compared to the baseline form.

### Experience and intention to use the site

People report greater intentions to use the current iteration (Prototype 2) than either the baseline form or Prototype 1.

### Trust and confidence

People report equal ratings of trust and confidence in reporting for all three versions of the form. They are also equally likely to recommend each of them.

### Report quality

Each report was rated by three RCMP staff members and averaged. Reports from the current iteration (Prototype 2) and the baseline rated as of the same quality.

### Conclusions 
We found that participants were more likely to:
- Complete and submit a report when using the prototypes
- Rate the prototypes as more usable
- Use the current iteration prototype 

We achieved these results by:
- Reducing the number of form fields
- Writing easy-to-read questions
- Providing clarity on purpose and next steps
- Including emotional reassurance and guidance

The current iteration (Prototype 2): 
- Maintains quality with improved usability and loyalty
- Increases the quantity of reports submitted
