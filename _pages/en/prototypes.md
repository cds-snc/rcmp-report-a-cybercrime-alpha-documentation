# Learning by building and testing prototypes

In Alpha, the delivery team focused on building prototypes, testing those with users, learning from them, and iterating based on what we learned. By putting something tangible in front of people who have been affected by cybercrime or fraud, we were able to learn about what they needed and adjust prototypes to address more of those needs. You can find an overview of the prototypes we've built, tested, and iterated below.

## [Concept 1: Reporting cybercrime with a single identifier](https://rac-concept-1.herokuapp.com/) 
*(Built in April 2019)*

### Goals
The first concept was based on the hypothesis that the effort it takes to submit information around a cybercrime event should be correlated to the impact of the crime. 

### Features
A low-burden tool to alert the RCMP of a suspicious email address, phone number, or website:
 * Landing page that outlines the purpose
 * Omnibox input field that submits a single identifier
 * Data visualization that shows victims they are not alone

### Outcomes
Testing the concept with seniors and newcomers to Canada, we learned about:
 * Making the purpose and value of the service clearer and having a strong call to action
 * Being explicit about which government or law enforcement entity is receiving the report
 * Using language that resonnates with victims:
   * Precise, direct, instructions
   * "Scams" rather than "cybercrimes"
   * "Reporting" rather than "sharing"

## [Concept 2: Finding out where to report cybercrime](https://rac-concept-2.herokuapp.com/) 
*(Built in May 2019)*

### Goals
The second concept was based on the hypothesis that constructing a visual narrative can help triage victims to the appropriate avenue for sharing their cybercrime experience.

### Features
A decision tree to find the most relevant reporting option:
 * Side-by-side cards with illustrations that present a choice 
 * Navigation to one clear reporting option that aligns with choices made  
 
### Outcomes
Testing the concept with library-goers, we learned about:
 * How victims think about cybercrime and their reporting options
 * Reasons why many victims prefer to talk to someone over the phone:
   * Emotional reassurance
   * Advice and guidance
   * They believed it would result in action
 * Expections victims have in receiving a follow-up:
   * For validation
   * To confirm their report was received
   * In case more information is needed

## Prototype 1: Reporting in a structured form
*(Built in July 2019)*

### Goals
This prototype was designed to test how victims of cybercrime engage with a form that asks preset questions. It was based on the closest online reporting service that exists in Canada, the [basline fraud reporting system](https://report-a-cybercrime.alpha.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/CAFCFRS/), that was redesigned with simplified layout, content, and interactions, and applying early learnings from Alpha. 

### Features
A re-designed baseline fraud reporting form that simplifies content, layout and interactions, and applies early learnings:
 * Mostly structured input fields
 * Landing page with purpose and what to prepare
 * Divided into short skippable sections
   * Event description (what, when, how)
   * Money lost (focus on impact rather than fraud type)
   * Scammer details (suspect information pared down)
   * Evidence (file upload without description)
   * Contact details (only asking for name, email, phone number)
 * Review report information
 * Reference number provided

## Prototype 2: Reporting in an open form
*(Built in August 2019)*

### Goals
This prototype was designed to test how victims respond to an open form. It applies learnings from research with victims and police of jurisdiction, including the need to provide emotional reassurance, guidance, and setting clear expectations.

### Features
Iteration of Prototype 1
 * Provides flexibility in how people report
 * Asks about impact
 * Uses reassuring language
 * Provides guidance on what happens next

### [See Prototype 2](https://www.report-a-cybercrime.alpha.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/p2) 


### Outcomes
