# Learning by building and testing

In Alpha, we focused on building prototypes, testing those with users, learning from them and iterating based on what we learned. By putting something tangible in front of people at the earliest opportunity, we were able to learn a lot. 

We gathered both qualitative and quantitative insights from research directly with people who have been affected by cybercrime and fraud. As we learned more about what people need, we addressed more of those needs in the prototypes.

You can find an overview of all the prototypes below:

[Concept 1: Reporting cybercrime with a single identifier](https://rac-concept-1.herokuapp.com/)

[Concept 2: Finding out where to report cybercrime](https://rac-concept-2.herokuapp.com/)

[Prototype 1: A simplified version of the baseline form](https://www.report-a-cybercrime.alpha.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/p1)

[Prototype 2: A more flexible version of prototype 1 with reassurance and guidance](https://www.report-a-cybercrime.alpha.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/p2)

# [Concept 1: Reporting cybercrime with a single identifier](https://rac-concept-1.herokuapp.com/)

## Goals
The first concept was based on the hypothesis that the effort it takes to submit information around a cybercrime event should be correlated to the impact of the crime. 

## Features
A low-burden tool to alert the RCMP:
 * Landing page that outlines the purpose
 * Omnibox input field that submits a single identifier
 * Data visualization that shows victims they are not alone

## Outcomes
 * Clarified the purpose of the prototype
 * Learned how victims expect to share their experiences
 * Revealed language that resonnates with victims

# [Concept 2: Finding out where to report cybercrime](https://rac-concept-2.herokuapp.com/)

## Goals
The second concept was based on the hypothesis that constructing a visual narrative can help triage victims to the appropriate avenue for sharing their cybercrime experience. 

## Features
A decision tree to find the most relevant reporting option
 * Side-by-side cards with illustrations that present a choice 
 * Navigation to one clear option that aligns with choices made  

## Outcomes
 * Learned about how victims think about cybercrime and make decisions about where to report
   * What constitutes an urgent situation
   * What type of information victims have to report
   * When victims prefer to talk to someone 
   * How victims expect to receive a follow-up

# [Baseline fraud reporting form](https://report-a-cybercrime.alpha.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/CAFCFRS/)

## Goals
The baseline fraud reporting form was the closest online service of this kind that exists in Canada. It was used as a starting point for prototype 1.

## Features
Full fraud reporting form
 * Structured form fields
 * Contact details
 * Fraud type selection
 * Suspect information
 * File upload
 * Reference number
