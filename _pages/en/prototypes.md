In Alpha, we focused on building, testing, learning and iterating. By putting tangible prototypes in front of people at the earliest opportunity, we were able to learn a lot. 


# [Concept 1: Reporting cybercrime with a single identifier](https://rac-concept-1.herokuapp.com/)

## Goals
The first concept was based on the hypothesis that the effort it takes to submit information around a cybercrime event should be correlated to the impact of the crime. 

## Features
A low-burden tool to alert the RCMP:
 * Landing page that outlines the purpose of the service
 * Omnibox input field that submits a single identifier
 * Data visualization that shows victims they are not alone

## What we learned
 * Clarified the purpose of the prototype
 * Learned about how victims expect to share their experiences
 * Revealed what language resonnates with people who have been affected by cybercrime


# [Concept 2: Finding out where to report cybercrime](https://rac-concept-2.herokuapp.com/)

## Goals
The second concept was based on the hypothesis that constructing a visual narrative helps triage victims to the appropriate avenue for sharing their cybercrime experience. 

## Features
A decision tree to find the most relevant reporting option
 * Cards with illustrations to make 
 * 

## What we learned
