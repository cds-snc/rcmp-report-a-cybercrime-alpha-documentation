### Help us improve the Canada Pension Plan Disability benefit

Weâ€™d like to speak to you if your health condition means you find it hard or impossible to work. This is to help with research we're doing into ways to improve the Canada Pension Plan Disability Benefit (CPP-D). You don't need any experience with CPP-D to participate.

If you would like to help us, or know someone else who can, please contact [adrianne.lee@tbs-sct.gc.ca](mailto:adrianne.lee@tbs-sct.gc.ca) for more information on how to be involved.

#### How you can help

We'd like to talk to you (via phone, video chat, or in-person) and show you some work in-progress to get your feedback. The conversation shouldn't take longer than 30 minutes, and we can reach you at a time that's convenient for you.

#### Your privacy
You're volunteering to take part in this research, so you can choose to stop participating at any time for any reason.

We (the Canadian Digital Service) will make sure your responses are confidential, which means they will not be linked back to anyone.

Your participation and answers will not impact your relationship with the Canadian Digital Service, Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC), or any part of the Government of Canada.

We handle all personal information in accordance with the Privacy Act, and we'll give you a copy of our Privacy Statement.
