# Who the users are and what they need

In Discovery, the main goal is understanding who might need to use this service. One-on-one conversations with potential users are at the centre of this, to test and broaden our assumptions about what reporters need. Our goal was to determine if there was a need for a reporting service. We determined that yes, there is a need, but that victims of cybercrime expect help beyond reporting itself.

Most victims don't identify themselves as victims of "cybercrime". They might use more specific terms like "identity theft" or "romance scam" or they might be most comfortable describing it. They do not use the same categories to describe a cybercrime event that law enforcement use. 

We observed phone calls at the CAFC, interviewed potential and actual victims of cybercrime and also collected accounts of witnessing and falling victim to cybercrime through a [story gathering tool](https://tell-us.cds-snc.ca). 


Ultimately we know everyone's affected by cybercrime. Since everyone is a potential victim, we focused on two groups:
  - 18-35 year olds, who are most likely to be victims of cybercrime
  - Over 55 year olds, who lose the most from cybercrime and fraud

As we moved further, we shifted the focus from demographic groups and started organizing the audience by motivations.

## What are the motivations of people who do report

Our research suggested that people who report cybercrime fall into several "archetypes". Not all people fall into these categories and some fall into multiple, having mmore of these motivations.

### Altruists
They want to report crime to help prevent it from happening to others. They are trying to protect others by helping the authorities. They report because "it's the right thing to do". 
> "I bet someday, somehow this will help someone else from getting ensnared in the crime."
*- Altruists*

### Solvers
They're trying to solve the problems crime poses for them or their friends and family. They want to recover money, clean computers, stop anything else bad from happening. They report to police, but only if they believe the police can help them mitigate the damage of the crime.
> "I just don't think they'd have time to read this, so why should I spend time writing it?"
*- Solvers*

### Justice seekers
They want the criminals caught. They're looking for "hands in cuffs". They might want their money recovered, but they really want justice done. They collect and submit evidence about the crime and are sometimes disappointed when no investigation proceeds.
> "Get [my report] in quick so we can get the guy in cuffs."
*- Justice seekers*

## What the public needs in a reporting system 

All of these archetypes have some shared needs from the service. Here are some of the key needs the public has:
  - Low-burden reporting
  - Nudges to report
  - Mitigation advice
  - Emotional reassurance
  - Evidence sharing
  
## What law enforcement need in a reporting system

Meeting law enforcement needs all starts with making sure we're getting comprehensive stories from victims. Here are some of the key needs of law enforcement:
  - Comprehensive narratives
  - Categorization
  - Key fields
  - Evidence
