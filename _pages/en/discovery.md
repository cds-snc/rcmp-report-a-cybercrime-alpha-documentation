# Who the users are and what they need

Ultimately we know everyone's affected by cybercrime. 

To test and broaden our assumptions about what people need, we held one-on-one conversations with potential and actual victims of cybercrime and collected stories from people who've witnessed and fallen victim to cybercrime through a [story gathering tool](https://tell-us.cds-snc.ca). 

We learned that most victims don't identify themselves as victims of "cybercrime". They might use more specific terms like "identity theft" or might be most comfortable describing their experience. They do not use the same categories to describe a cybercrime event that law enforcement use. 

**Public needs:** 
> * Low-burden reporting
> * Nudges to report
> * Mitigation advice
> * Emotional reassurance
> * Evidence sharing
 
**Police needs:**
 > * Suspect details
 > * Reporter contact information
 > * Dates, times and locations of events
 > * How people where contacted
 > * What kind of technology was affected
 > * What was lost or damaged
 > * What was said or done for this to happen
 > * A statement in the first person
 > * A linear story and timeline
 > * Supporting evidence

# Why people report cybercrime

## Altruism

Altruists want to report crime to help prevent it from happening to others. They are trying to protect others by helping the authorities. They report because "it's the right thing to do". 

> *"I bet someday, somehow this will help someone else from getting ensnared in the crime."*

## Problem solving

Solvers try to fix the problems the crime poses for them or their friends and family. They want to recover money, clean computers, stop anything else bad from happening. They report to police, but only if they believe the police can help them mitigate the damage of the crime.

> *"I just don't think they'd have time to read this, so why should I spend time writing it?"*

## Justice seeking

Justice seekers want the criminals caught; they look for "hands in cuffs". They might want their money recovered, but they really want justice done. They collect and submit evidence about the crime and are sometimes disappointed when no investigation proceeds.

> *"Get [my report] in quick so we can get the guy in cuffs."*

# Why people don't report cybercrime

## Feeling embarrassed, ashamed, at fault

If a victim feels like they did something wrong, they will not share crucial details about their experience. People don't report when they are not aware that what they experienced warrants finding help.

## Not knowing what the options are for reporting

Because victims don't know what a cybercrime is (in legal terms), they don't know who to turn to for help, and are often unable to find help to begin with. They stop reporting when they are overwhelmed by an ambiguous process. 

## Being disappointed or intimidated by law enforcement in the past

If this doesn't happen their faith becomes mistrust and they are not likely to report in the future. For those who have had negative interactions with the police before,  reporting a cybercrime to the police can feel like a dead-end. When victims complete a report, they expect follow-up and respect from the police. If police are not responsive to victims, victims avoid going to them for help when another incident occurs.
