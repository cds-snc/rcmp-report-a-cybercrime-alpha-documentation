# Who the users are and what they need

Ultimately we know everyone's affected by cybercrime. 

To test and broaden our assumptions about what they need, we held one-on-one conversations with potential and actual victims of cybercrime. We also collected accounts of witnessing and falling victim to cybercrime through a [story gathering tool](https://tell-us.cds-snc.ca). 

We learned that most victims don't identify themselves as victims of "cybercrime". They might use more specific terms like "identity theft" or they might be most comfortable describing their experiences. They also do not use the same categories to describe a cybercrime event that law enforcement use. 

Their needs include: low-burden reporting, nudges to report, mitigation advice, emotional reassurance, and evidence sharing.

# Reasons why do people report cybercrime

**Altruism**
They want to report crime to help prevent it from happening to others. They are trying to protect others by helping the authorities. They report because "it's the right thing to do". 
> "I bet someday, somehow this will help someone else from getting ensnared in the crime."

**Problem solving**
They're trying to solve the problems crime poses for them or their friends and family. They want to recover money, clean computers, stop anything else bad from happening. They report to police, but only if they believe the police can help them mitigate the damage of the crime.
> "I just don't think they'd have time to read this, so why should I spend time writing it?"

**Justice seeking**
They want the criminals caught. They're looking for "hands in cuffs". They might want their money recovered, but they really want justice done. They collect and submit evidence about the crime and are sometimes disappointed when no investigation proceeds.
> "Get [my report] in quick so we can get the guy in cuffs."
