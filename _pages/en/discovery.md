# Who the users are and what do they need?

In Discovery, the main goal is understanding the "who". Who might need to use this tool?

One-on-one conversations with potential users are at the centre of this. Ultimately we know everyone's affected by cybercrime. To test and broaden our assumptions about what reporters need, we started by listening to people talk about what they think, feel, and do.

Since everyone is a potential victim, we focused on two groups:
  - 18-35 year olds, who are most likely to be victims of cybercrime
  - Over 55 year olds, who lose the most from cybercrime and fraud
  
As we move further, we'll stop focusing on demographic groups and start organizing the audience by motivations are.
 
## What are the motivations of people who do report?

### Altruists
They want to report crime to help prevent it from happening to others. 
> "I bet someday, somehow this will help someone else from getting ensnared in the crime."
*- Altruists*

### Solvers
They're trying to solve the problems crime poses for them or their friends and family. They want to recover money, clean computers, stop anything else bad from happening.
> "I just don't think they'd have time to read this, so why should I spend time writing it?"
*- Solvers*

### Justice seekers
They want the criminals caught. They might want their money recovered, but they really want justice done.
> "Get [my report] in quick so we can get the guy in cuffs."
*- Justice seekers*

## What the public needs in a reporting system 

All of these archetypes have some shared needs from the service. Here are some of the key needs the public has:
  - Low-burden reporting
  - Nudges to report
  - Mitigation advice
  - Emotional reassurance
  - Evidence sharing
  
## What law enforcement need in a reporting system

Meeting law enforcement needs all starts with making sure we're getting comprehensive stories from victims. Here are some of the key needs of law enforcement:
  - Comprehensive narratives
  - Categorization
  - Key fields
  - Evidence
