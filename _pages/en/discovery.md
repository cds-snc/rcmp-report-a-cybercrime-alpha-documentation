# Who the users are and what they need

Ultimately we know everyone's affected by cybercrime. 

To test and broaden our assumptions about what people need, we held one-on-one conversations with potential and actual victims of cybercrime and collected stories from people who've witnessed and fallen victim to cybercrime through a [story gathering tool](https://tell-us.cds-snc.ca). 

We learned that most victims don't identify themselves as victims of "cybercrime". They might use more specific terms like "identity theft" or might be most comfortable describing their experience. They also do not use the same categories to describe a cybercrime event that law enforcement use. Their needs include: low-burden reporting, nudges to report, mitigation advice, emotional reassurance, and evidence sharing.

# Motivations for reporting

We learned about the different motivations that people have for reporting cybercrime to police:

## Altruism

Altruists want to report crime to help prevent it from happening to others. They are trying to protect others by helping the authorities. 

> "I bet someday, somehow this will help someone else from getting ensnared in the crime."

They report because "it's the right thing to do". 

## Problem solving

Solvers try to fix the problems the crime poses for them or their friends and family. They want to recover money, clean computers, stop anything else bad from happening. 

> "I just don't think they'd have time to read this, so why should I spend time writing it?"

They report to police, but only if they believe the police can help them mitigate the damage of the crime.

## Justice seeking

Justice seekers want the criminals caught; they look for "hands in cuffs". They might want their money recovered, but they really want justice done. 

> "Get [my report] in quick so we can get the guy in cuffs."

They collect and submit evidence about the crime and are sometimes disappointed when no investigation proceeds.
