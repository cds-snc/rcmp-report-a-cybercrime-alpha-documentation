* Show whatâ€™s possible and share insights and resources others can use.

## Audiences
* Canadian public service
* Federal departments interested in working with us (potential partners); or working like us (capacity building)
* Service actors/stakeholders (CSE/CCCS, StatsCan, Public Safety, etc.)
* People who might participate in research or testing
