In this phase, we released a pilot to take in reports of cybercrime from victims. This pilot wasn’t just focused on the website that takes in the reports, but the service surrounding the intake of reports, such as: how analysts will review and triage reports, how AI can help us in this or what victims need from the service beyond submitting a report. These findings will help us create a better end-to-end service, with the goal to increase quality of reports by using human-centred design.

**Outlining the end-to-end service**\
To kick off this phase, we hosted a workshop to understand how the service would work, with a focus on the report’s journey. We unpacked all of the steps that happen before and after a victim hits “submit”. We took this framework and mapped out the business, tech, security and partnership considerations that we would need to take into account to bring this service to life.

The high level phases of the report journey include:

* **Occurrence** - An event occurs where a cybercrime is attempted or carried out
* **Report** - Someone reports the crime or attempted crime that has occurred
* **Analyze** - The report is analyzed to understand the impact, severity and
* **Triage** - Based on analysis, the report is triaged.
* **Dissemination** - Gather more intel and track status of investigations.

*An outline of the service blueprint:*

**Planning the Pilot**\
Once we had the framework and considerations mapped out, we moved into planning the pilot version of this service. We looked at each step of the process to understand how we could do it successfully implement features while limiting time and resources spent on it, so that we could test a solution and iterate quickly.

Once we had assessed the minimum version of the service that we could create, we translated that into a backlog and started to build the pilot end-to-end service.

**What’s next?**\
Now that the pilot is up and running, we will need to plan the path forward. This will involve creating a roadmap for how we will scale the pilot into the full service, and start to address some of the larger questions we have, such as:

* Where will this service live online?
* How will people find it?
* How will we use AI to help analyze and triage reports?
* Where will these reports be stored in the long run?
