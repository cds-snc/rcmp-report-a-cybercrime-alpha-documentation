# Help us improve this service

We’d like to speak to you if you have recently experienced a cybercrime, fraud, or if you've been impacted by having one of your devices hacked or compromised.

This would involve a chat that shouldn't take longer than 30 minutes (via phone, video chat, or in-person) where we show you some work in-progress to get your feedback.

The Canadian Digital Service will make sure your responses are confidential, which means they will not be linked back to anyone. Your participation and answers will not impact your relationship with the Canadian Digital Service, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), or any part of the Government of Canada.

If you're interested, you can contact [melissa.banyard@tbs-sct.gc.ca](mailto:melissa.banyard@tbs-sct.gc.ca) for more information on how to be involved.
